 "The Great Creator Emulators" is   a book title.
As               an emulator   if     self labeled
arrogance, bigotry, insolence, intolerance are postured.

The  word mind  the word person when used bigotry is      abstained.
Age, ethnicity, gender,  religion,   role         are not indicated.
All       minds     all  persons                  are     equally important!

By religion
at worst murder           is solicited;
at best  derisive worship is solicited;
control  infliction       is intended.

By "The Great Creator Emulators" control is denounced liberty is extolled.
Liberty when sustained The Great Creator is emulated.

Matthew 19:17  Mark 10:18 please consider.  God only is good.
One self   as   chosen, as righteous, as special    a   label do not don.
A   title  when donned  as bigoted    as intolerant the self  is postured.
