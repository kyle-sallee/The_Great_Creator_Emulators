By  threat  liberty    deprivation    is attempted.
"Do as I say or I shoot,"  echos.
5   unarmed persons    flee.
The hostage person  is murdered!  Who is culpable?

The Great Creator,          the firearm  manufacturer,  the police,
the assailant,              the fleeing  persons,       the victim,
the assailant's parents,    the gun,                    the video  game hackers,
the assailant's teachers,   the legislators,            the weapon manufacturer?
the bullet, the cartridge,  the munition manufacturer       blame?
For each    the culpability can be endorsed or denied.

The retribution game when desired
the blame       game is   played.

An     atrocity  when allowed a horrible culpable feeling persists.
By the assailant person
by the fleeing   persons
by the victim    person
the    murder    atrocity to sustain the proclivity was attained.  Surprised?
