Proverbs 23:1-3  1 Peter 5:8  please consider.
Weak meat strong eat.  Jungle law is cited.
To sensation max importance when accorded
to all else  the importance is   abstained.  Addicts are prey!

By   conquerors to   each slave no more importance than livestock is accorded.
At   bait       when lunging
like animals    when behaving
the  prejudice  is   solicited.

The first one is free!
An  addiction to sustain as payment most atrocities can be demanded.
The addicts      comply!
