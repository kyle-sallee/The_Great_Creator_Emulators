Payment when     demanded to comply
wealth  must be  attained.
Wealth  if   not attained
deprivation  is  inflicted.

A    deprivation system
when inflicted a kill
when attained  a murder was intended was inflicted.

A    deprivation system
when endorsed
when sustained
with enslavement
with murder
complicity  results
culpability results.

A    deprivation system and         human      sacrifice are tantamount.
The  deprivation system to  sustain humans are sacrificed!
