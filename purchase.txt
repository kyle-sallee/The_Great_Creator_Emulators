Sans payment   an apple  eat.    The core discard?     The store exit?
What happens?  Nothing?  Arrest, prosecution, confinement, deprivation, fines?

The  liberty since deprived
the  payment since demanded
the  payment to    attain    enslavement
must         be    endured   or
must         be    inflicted.

Enslavement to    inflict atrocities  are inflicted.
Atrocities  since sin     enslavement is  sin.

Slave produced  good and services
when  purchased      and tax when paid
the   enslavement    is  endorsed.

Purchase since sin most days minds sin.
A  lawful person is
a  sinful person.
