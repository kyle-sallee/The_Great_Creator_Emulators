By  war atrocity   is  not  ended; is  inflicted; liberty is  not attained;
the     conquerors the dead and    the slaves             are     decided.

Upon any person  an  atrocity infliction when not   justified
upon all persons the atrocity infliction is   not   justified.
War                                      is   NEVER justified.

Liberty by   The Great Creator     is endorsed.
Liberty when sustained the freedom is attained.
Liberty and            the freedom to end each freedom fighter fights!

By  give    and forgive liberty is     approximated.
By  bullets and weapons liberty is not approximated,
but death   and dismemberment   is     inflicted!

All citizens all soldiers are pawns.  As pawns die?  As persons live?
