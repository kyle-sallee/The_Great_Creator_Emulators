By parent minds upon young minds atrocity when inflicted why  when asked
by parent minds "because I love you,"     when said
as obsessive    oppressive control        the  love      idea was  empowered.

Most        minds lie and        disappoint.
Upon parent minds     punishment while abstained upon young minds is  inflicted.
The  parent minds are bigoted!                   The  young minds are tortured!

Matthew 18:21-35  please consider.
By  parent minds a      young mind's      defiance    is  seldom forgiven.
By  parent minds compassion,  liberty,    forgiveness are seldom taught.
But atrocity     infliction,  compliance, defiance    are always taught.

Matthew 18:6  please consider.
About the   atrocity infliction   called parental       love
by    Jesus to  damn "be drowned" was    metaphorically retorted.

On freedom worlds care giver roles while available parent roles do not exist.
