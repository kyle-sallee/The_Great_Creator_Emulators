"Paydom Freedom"              book please read.

"The Great Creator Emulators" and religion differ.
For tax avoidance purpose only as religion can be classified.

With  burning bushes
with  clouds  conversations did not become!
God's words                 are not pretended.

The    book    was not arbitrarily    contrived.
From   observation the realizations   became and were inscribed.
Better reality         approximations remain possible.

A   threat   is   not    intended nor inflicted.
The reader's full agency and full volition is desired.
Aft reading
the reader's liberty since sustained
the reader's opinion is    sustained.
