By      the Buddhism 8 fold      path
nirvana as  desired    is        asserted.
Liberty as  essential  since not asserted
freedom     worlds     and
nirvana     differ.
Nirvana if  attained
rebirth is  abstained.

Nirvana    afore          attainment freedom   worlds  why not visit?
On freedom worlds liberty sustaining Buddhists persons are born.
