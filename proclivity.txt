By  atrocity  infliction          by   sin       damnation is not solicited.
By  atrocious proclivities        when sustained damnation is not solicited.
In  nations   to  live the desire when sustained damnation is     solicited.

An  atrocity  when      endured      an atrocious idea       can become.
An  atrocious idea when    empowered an atrocious proclivity     becomes.
The atrocious idea when disempowered an atrocious proclivity     ends.

The atrocious ideas
by  free      minds are easily disempowered,
by  slave     minds are seldom disempowered.

The atrocious idea       and a   pathogen if   similar
the atrocious proclivity and the symptoms seem similar.
The atrocity  when inflicted to  others   is   vectored.

On  freedom worlds    atrocity  infliction is not welcome are not sustained.
On   paydom worlds    atrocity  infliction is     rewarded.
On  which   worlds do atrocious minds      prefer rebirth?
