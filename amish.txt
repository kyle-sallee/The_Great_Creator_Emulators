On        paydom    Earth     profit or perish is inflicted.
Although  pacifists although  technophobic
the       Amish     are       profitable.
The       Amish     are       not poor.

Matthew 19:24  please consider.

By   technology by wealth the damnation is not attained.
In a nation     to live   the desire    is     attained.
