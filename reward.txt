Liberty when deprived  when complicit wealth is attained.
Liberty when sustained what           reward is possible?

Matthew 13:44-46  please consider.  Convinced?  Who would be?
Matthew  6:19-21  please consider.  Better?

On freedom worlds    deprivation   since        not inflicted
by self    duration, effort, skill and tenacity or
by merely  asking    just    about     anything is  attained.

Sans   money    do      games  seems uninteresting,  easy?
On the contrary free    minds  are   magnitudes more capable.
At anything the best to become is    not easily attained.

The best    challenges  the best games  the best everything
on  freedom worlds ONLY are experienced.

Paydom    worlds  are  like kiddy pools
where     persons piss and 
unskilled persons gulp.
