Luke 11:9-13  Matthew 7:7-12  please consider.  Asking is exalted.
By   The Great Creator     more than enough is already provided!
From The Great Creator for more do   not    ask.
From bigoted   wealthy               minds  ask.

Purchase when possible ask is precluded.
Purchase as   proper   where  exalted
ask,     beg, borrow       as unscrupulous is regarded.

On   paydom worlds ask, borrow, give
as   shameful       is   regarded;
the  payment demand is   lawful;
sans payment use    is   criminalized.

Asking as shameful if   regarded
is     a  shameful life desired?

On freedom worlds by  effort, duration, and volition or
by asking  goods  and services          are attained.
