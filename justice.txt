Romans 12:17-21  please consider.
"By 2 wrongs 1 right is not made," a familiar cliche is cited.
By  righteous  action   only righteousness becomes.

By  legislation threats are inflicted.
By  prosecution confinement, deprivation, kills are inflicted.
By  prosecution by  legislation liberty         is  deprived.
By  prosecution the retribution when inflicted  the word justice is used.
All justice         since       not  righteous  is  atrocious!

John 8:1-11  please consider.

For minds    infallible righteousness     is not possible.
An  atrocity when       inflicted justice is not helpful.  Help is helpful!

On  freedom    worlds
retribution is seldom inflicted and
justice     is never  inflicted!
