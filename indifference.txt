"Upon righteous persons atrocity why does God allow," vehemently shout?

Atrocity when endured indifference if surmised guess      again.
Atrocity to   inflict the choice   if deprived liberty is denied.

By  The Great Creator indifference or disinterest if attained
all existence like  a candle would be snuffed out.
But Sol still shines!

By The Great Creator birthrights are abundantly provided.
By bigoted   minds   atrocities  are abundantly inflicted.
