Luke 14:33-34  Mark 9:50  Matthew 5:13  please consider.
Atrocities when endured corruption results.
On freedom worlds
atrocities      since seldom endured
corruption      since seldom attained
mitigation lore is    seldom researched.

Proverbs 4:14-17  please consider.
As an anchorite unless living atrocities are daily endured.
