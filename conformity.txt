By Kyle Sallee    what tie     on Tuesday  is worn?
A  neck tie,   a  cloth        manacle,       why wear?
Bigotry when      desired      pointless      questions  are asked.

By  free minds:
dogma    is   not endorsed is not selected;
the self is       chosen;
by  self each     decision is     decided.

By  The Great Creator    reasoning    ability  and liberty are granted.
Reasoning and liberty if abstained if deprived the gifts   are wasted!
