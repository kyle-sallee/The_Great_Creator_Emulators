Galatians 6:7 please consider.
Control   if  inflicted is endured, and minds are hostage, prisoner, slave.

Matrimony when inflicted: alimony; divorce;
progeny companionship loss;
spouse  companionship loss are tacitly threatened and as retribution inflicted.

By death  by divorce      by murder  by prison by suicide matrimony can end.
By deceit by emancipation by murder  by juvie  by suicide
from         parents         escape  is possible.

"I work.  I earn money.  I put a roof over your head.
 For gratitude the least you could do is obey," by parents is often exclaimed.

The parent  because a compliant    slave
the progeny as      a compliant    slave     expect, force?
Rather than to        progeny to enslavement the     importance is accorded.

Non compliance to mitigate the   young minds
in  cribs  are caged or in rooms are   confined.

In 2 parents homes  ideal care    is   not provided.
As   wage    slaves when  already fatigued
for  care    giving the   energy  does not exist.

While young   ill care when received
as    parents ill care is   provided.
An    old     book     in a new cover when placed
the   content does     not  differ.

"What was good enough for me is good enough for my kids," by parents is said.

Atrocity infliction is cyclic.
As insufficient until asserted until rejected the infliction continues.

By  matrimony by  parenting when inflicted complicated problems become.
For matrimony for parenting the  best      possible    outcomes since unlikely
if            not inflicted the  worst     possible    outcomes are   precluded.

About a freedom world Kyle Sallee's opinion follows.

The   care   givers   are    not disinterested, fatigued, ignorant, scant.
In    baby   turtle   homes
the   care   givers   while  active
young minds  explore, laugh, learn, live.

Youth       and ignorance   are not criminalized.
Confinement and deprivation are not inflicted.
