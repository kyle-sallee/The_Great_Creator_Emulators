In the bible at least 42 times the phrase "eternal life" occurs.

Immortality and   eternal  life  differ.
Immortality while boring   on a  paydom world is also oppressive!
Immortality if    attained to do anything why    not  procrastinate?

2 Peter 3:8-9  please consider.
The freedom   required proclivities to  attain a lifetime might not suffice.
For all minds eternal  rebirth  why not offer?

On paydom worlds only if reborn is eternal torment not approximated?
