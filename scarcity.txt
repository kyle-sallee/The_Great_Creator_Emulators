On   Earth    during    the   20th and 21st centuries:
in   most     wardrobes about 100  outfits  hang;
by   grocery  stores
by   home     owners
each year     in   food
many billions kilograms are      discarded;
by   the      dominant  criminal organizations
food is       purchased and      buried.

Laissez faire     trade          if sustained
food    prices    would   tank.
Food if free      control would     diminish.
The     comply or starve  threat    would vanish!
A       scarcity  deceit         is being inflicted!

More than enough for everyone
the  clothes, energy, food, homes, technology, water already exists.
Enslavement compliance to attain premeditated  lethal deprivation is inflicted.
