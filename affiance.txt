The   future    if known
a     divorce   if inevitable
would matrimony be wanted?     By adulterers yes?  By others no?

The future to surmise about potential    spouses
an  adequate  reality approximation   is required.

Rematrimony when done       the prior   spouse                 was  deceived.
Deception   when inflicted  adequate    reality approximations were deprived.
The  future to   accurately anticipate  the     liberty        was  deprived.
By   deception   liberty    deprivation                        was  intended.

The   future  is  not easily   anticipated.
By    promise liberty since    deprived
every promise is      innately atrocious.
