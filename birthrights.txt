For  life  every atom is borrowed.
Upon death every atom is returned.
By  The Great Creator all was created.
By  persons           all is  borrowed.

All art
all atoms
all energy
all science
all technology are every persons' birthrights.
Nutritious food, pure water, and homes are birthrights examples.

By  The Great Creator  liberty is     intended.
For birthright use the payment is not demanded.

By minds enslavement to inflict for birthright use payment is demanded.
Birthrights use when deprived death, discomfort, sickness, suicide can result.

With payment birthright use when demanded slavers       are emulated.
Sans payment birthright use when done The Great Creator is  emulated.
