Lunch  money
by     parent if given
by     bully  if stolen
at     which
should anger  be directed?

By the heavenly father all is abundantly provided.
By the bigoted  minds  if  hoarded    if deprived God why damn?

Still angry?
Be    angry!
Deprivation while endured the anger should wax!
At    the   cause
at    the   deprivation inflicting bigoted minds
the   anger why   not   direct?
