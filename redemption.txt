A   grudge when empowered a retribution as justified is incorrectly surmised.
Sin since  inflicted; redemption   must be possible  if surmised
the grudge atrocious  proclivity                     is empowered.

Aft infliction an atrocity
un- infliction is impossible.

Matthew 5:38-48  Matthew 18:21-35  please consider.

By The Great Creator
atrocious  proclivities since not sustained.
the grudge proclivity   is    not sustained.

A grudge when impossible the forgiveness is impossible.
A grudge when impossible the redemption  is impossible.

On freedom worlds to be reborn
goodness,         forgiveness, redemption, trying, wealth are not required;
to liberty max    importance   must be accorded.
