Mark 9:42-50  Matthew 5:29-30  Matthew 18:8-9  please consider.

In parables Jesus lectured.  Physical dismemberment was NOT endorsed!

Like eyes, feet,  hands        the atrocious proclivities seem useful.
In Jesus's heaven to be reborn the atrocious proclivities must end.

Genitalia and   hand dismemberment do NOT help!
The  rape proclivity and
the theft proclivity must end.
The       capability if   deprived
the       proclivity can  remain.

To  a stump even if     reduced
the proclivities if     sustained in Jesus's heaven
the rebirth      is not attained.
