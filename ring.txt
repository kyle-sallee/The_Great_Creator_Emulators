By the parent  persons upon progeny persons deprivation was  often inflicted.
By the progeny person  upon parent  persons deprivation            infliction
as     parent  person  emulation    as      retribution was        desired.

From each parent   persons a worthless  ring  in   tissue paper was wrapped.
In   the  parents' bathroom  drawer the rings were placed.

When   asked,      "Did you take..."  "No,"     was  honestly replied.
By     3           meters       only  the rings were displaced.
Was    retribution successfully inflicted?

Two    worthless rings    while missing
expensive        jewelry  while retained
theft  can       not            logically be  surmised!
By     parent    persons  theft           was surmised          and
sans   evidence  the      maid  person    was accused, defamed, and fired.

Retribution  to  abstain  cover  up to    abstain   were  learned.
Of parental  retribution  since  afraid   the truth was   never revealed.
If confessed for the maid person a better outcome   would have  become.
