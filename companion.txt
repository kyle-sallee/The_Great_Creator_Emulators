Psalm   103:20    please consider.  To God angels are compliant.
Genesis   1:26-28 please consider.
Angels since  smart liberty was deprived.  Angels have destructive potential.
Humans since  dumb  liberty was intended.  Humans were God's pets.
For    angels disobedience  is  sin.
For    humans deprivation   is  sin.

Genesis 3:1-5 please consider.  In angelic likeness humanity was redesigned.
Heterosapiens became.
Ethnicity                since attained bigotry, racism  soon followed.
Reasoning and compliance since attained law,     slavery soon followed.

Genesis 3:3 please consider.  The forbidden tree was created and asserted.
The human genome modification was allowed,  anticipated, intended, desired!
The desired   appreciation
the desired   deference  to   attain
the opposite, defiance,  also         must   be possible.
As  worthy    companions to   become
the defiance  capacity   and  choice  must      exist.
Liberty when  sustained  a    worthy  companion becomes.
