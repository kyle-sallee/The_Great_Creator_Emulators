Among paydom    worlds most slaves   produce.
Low   quality   goods  low  quality  services with
low   duration  in     high quantity are mass produced.

Among freedom   worlds less persons  produce.
High  quality   goods  high quality  services with
high  durations        when required are      produced.

From  abundance from   diminished    production
the   freedom   worlds into castedom worlds sometimes degenerate.

From  about 1600    to about 1865 on the North American continent
for   non   white      skin  persons the opportunity    were  limited;
for   the   black      skin  persons to  chattel labor  were  restricted.
While less  obvious a  21st  century     North American caste system remains.
The   opportunities    when  limited                  a caste system exists.

On  freedom worlds liberty since   sustained permission since not required
the opportunities  are not granted are   not limited
