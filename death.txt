"God let my ... die," ever shout?

A     personal  miracle when not granted
God's existence deny or God's    apathy expect?

For a personal miracle Jesus prayed and was executed!

By The Great Creator's death is intended.
By minds the inconvenience   is perceived.

Death   if vanquished over population follows and
eternal   enslavement is   inflicted.

Liberty  to attain  to extol    to sustain
by dying    another    opportunity becomes.
