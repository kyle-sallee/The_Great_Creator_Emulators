Genesis 1:26-29  please consider.
"Mankind to rule over man" is not written nor implied!

Importance by each mind      is       accorded.
Importance to accord  a vote is never required.
Importance to deprive a vote is       inflicted!

By atrocity    inflicting bigoted colluding minds
enslavement to inflict
voting      is inflicted.

By   voting      a    master     when selected
with enslavement the  complicity is   attained.
With voting      when complicit
the  compliance  also often      is   attained.

The atrocity inflicting bigoted colluding minds   when realized
a   monster  as   one's master  why       endorse why  vote?
