Matthew  7:21    James  2:14-26  Matthew  6:19-21  Matthew 13
Matthew  6:9-15  Luke  12:32-34  Matthew 18:21-35  please consider.
Heaven to attain God's will must be done.  How is explained.

Genesis 1:27  Psalm 103:20  please consider.
Sans liberty admiration is fear.
Sans liberty love       is obsession.
Fear and     obsession  if desired more angels can be created.
For  valued  companionship liberty must exist.

To humans liberty is intended.
To angels liberty is deprived.

By angels the dumb humans why  envy?
As companions the  humans were desired.
As servants   the  angels were desired.

To be compliant to be slaves to be angelic from humans angels want.

Liberty when sustained The Great Creator is emulated.
