A table follows.

World Type  Productivity  Pollution  Self Destruction Probability
Castedom    mid           mid        mid
 Freedom    low           low        low
  Paydom    high          high       inevitable

The ideal types  do   not fixate.  On paydom worlds castedom similarities exist.
By  the   world  type the denizen  proclivities are described.

Genesis 9  Matthew 7:6  please consider.  From the Great Flood what was learned?
Paradise to restart an opportunity was granted was squandered.
Through sacrifice if not attained the appreciation the importance is  abstained.
Heaven, freedom,  paradise, etc... can NOT be given!
In      freedom   an atrocious  mind and feces topped cappuccino  are similar.

The desired world to attain the matching proclivities must be attained.
