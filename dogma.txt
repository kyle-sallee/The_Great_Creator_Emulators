"thou shalt not disobey,  thou shalt not object,
 thou shalt not question, thou shalt not think," by religions seem implied?

Until the    18th    century      on   the     North American continent
indigenous   persons sans visa    with liberty lived and moved.
Legislation, money,  prosecution, taxation     were  not inflicted.
Goods when   needed  sans payment were given.

Culturcide, genocide was inflicted and from the continent the freedom vanished!

On  Earth     by bigoted minds atrocious life styles while forced
for centuries by free    minds liberty   life styles were  sustained.
The choice       when realized remains!

By self all alone    a  culture of one      to become the choice  is possible!
By self the opinions if quelled if hid more to join   the outcome is precluded.

By  authorship by   sharing self opinions are sustained.
The liberty    when sustained an opinion  to  proclaim
the authority  was  never        required.
