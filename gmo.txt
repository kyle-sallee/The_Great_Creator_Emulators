The corn genome when altered for The Great Creator's gift
the ownership   is   arrogantly  deceitfully claimed
and payment     is   atrociously deceitfully demanded.

In Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14
a  single note if modified can new ownership be claimed?

The    food          when inedible
a      lethal virus  when created  what will become?
Atomic power  plants when melted   what was  done?
