Proverbs 13:24  please consider.  Confine, deprive, torture are not written.
Footing when uncertain
the rod when planted
the fall and injury
are prevented.

By the phrase "spare the rod,"  assistance deprivation is intended.

The message when properly translated the following becomes.
"Assistance when deprived malice is intended."

The word child is not required is not used.
For all  persons assistance can be required and should not be deprived.
Attributes   and roles do not matter!

Physical abuse for inflicting the bible   is    not culpable!
By atrocious minds atrocities to  justify atrocious interpretations become.
