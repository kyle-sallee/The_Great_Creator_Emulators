By   religions   God  as presented why not reject?
Life and reality seem    present.
The  how and why as      uncertain why not admit?

About the  next    life  if   uncertain
the   same salient question   remains.
To    what ideas   importance accord?

By   self     if decided   liberty     is     attained.
To   others   if delegated enslavement is     attained.
Be   free?    Be enslaved?
That question to answer    religion    is not required.
