"Be a good little girl;
 be a good little boy;
 be a good child;
 be a good dog;"
bigotry and  control to inflict
compliance           to solicit
the     word good    is inflicted.

Parent  mind, "Be a good child or from Santa Claus coal only is received."
Parent  mind, "Do as I command.  My permission always ask.  Obey or else."
Free    mind, "For oneself decide.  For advice not permission ask.  Liberty."
Teacher mind, "Sit down!  Shut up!  Pay attention!"
Free    mind, "For 16 years attention was paid.  Refund please!"
Which   mind  is   preferred?

Luke 18:19  Matthew 19:17  Mark 10:18 please consider.
Good and compliance are not tantamount.
The Great Creator if emulated then good is emulated.
