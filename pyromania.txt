With matches a 4 year mind played.  In wood built worlds everything can blaze.

By  fire   deprivation if inflicted who is culpable?
The answer might   not be obvious.

For    the 4 year    mind  an entertaining honing environment was deprived.
Abject deprivation   since endured
any    entertainment would suffice.

For pyromania the paydom endorsing inflicting sustaining minds are culpable.

On   freedom      worlds until ready
in   baby turtle  homes  young minds    live.
By   interested   and    not   fatigued care  givers
by   computer     based        training
by   many fun and educational  rooms
many entertaining activities   are      provided.

Deprivation when inflicted many problems, like pyromania,     result.
Liberty     when sustained many problems, like pyromania, are abstained.
