Matthew 13:11-13  please consider.
A   decent approximation if provided opinions
as  facts  would be empowered
deceit     would be accused,
censorship would be inflicted.

Matthew 13  please consider.
By  Jesus  was     heaven      visited?
For heaven was the sales pitch effective?

Luke 12:32-34  Matthew 18:21-22  Matthew 7:13-14  please consider.
For  Jesus's heaven
the  boons   when        uncertain
the  entry   when nearly impossible
why  even    try?

By Christians to   enter heaven is seldom    tried.
As a foregone conclusion heaven is foolishly anticipated.
Matthew 7:21-23   please consider.
