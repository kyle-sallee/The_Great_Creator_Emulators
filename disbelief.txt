For life  to exist  how many precise factors must exist?
Millions, billions, trillions, more?
Was chemistry random?
Was physics   random?
Was DNA       random?

A coin's face          if seen can
a coin's opposite side be doubted?

Evolution and creationism are not opposed paradigms.
Life      if  not created if  not sustained
evolution is  not possible!
