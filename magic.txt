Matthew 6:9-13 please consider.

"Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name,"
The prayer for God since not intended the title and name are not included.

"Your kingdom come your will be done"
Liberty while   sustained freedom exists.
God's   will    since     liberty
God's   kingdom is        freedom.

"on Earth as it is in Heaven"
On freedom worlds    liberty is sustained.
On Earth   sustained liberty is requested.

"Give us today our daily bread."
By "bread" all birthrights       are represented.
By "give"  the sans payment  use is  requested.
By "daily" and "today"
the daily  attainment importance is  emphasized.

"And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors,"
Forgiveness when attained  retribution is abstained
Retribution when abstained atrocity    is abstained.
Rather than debt: atrocity; control; grudge; sin also fit.
The liberty ideas to approximate "give" and "forgive" are used.

"And lead us not into temptation/testing,"
On   abject deprivation inflicting paydom worlds with enslavement
when compliant     less wealth is obtained;
when inflicting    more wealth is obtained.
With wealth deprivation relief is purchased.
With wealth atrocity    infliction since rewarded
with        atrocity to comply or  to    inflict
the  temptation         constantly exists.

"but deliver us from evil,"  Rather than "evil" atrocity and enslavement fit.
Liberty to deprive     atrocities  are  inflicted.
Liberty    deprivation and enslavement if not evil then nothing is!

"For thine is the kingdom, the origin, the glory, for ever. Amen"
Liberty while sustained the freedom exists, and does not self destruct.

For Jesus's prayer a demystified translation follows.

Divine  will    is  liberty.
Liberty sustain and freedom becomes.
On      Earth   the freedom make.
Birthrights share.
Retribution abstain.
Atrocity do not endure do not inflict.
The freedom worlds only endure.  Now become.
