In  the   King James version  bible translation
the words damnation  and hell often occurs.

By  damn  condemnation is    intended.
Law where inflicted                  a   nation      exists.
Law and   liberty      since opposed all nations are damned.

On      freedom worlds
liberty since   sustained
law     since   abstained
nations are     abstained.  The freedom worlds and damnation differ!

The choice, one's liberty,     if delegated    enslavement since preferred
by  bigoted minds the atrocities, deprivation, enslavement are   inflicted.

Damnation  as  threat if surmised guess again!
Compliance and law    if extolled damnation since preferred is attained.

Matthew 6:24  please consider.
By Jesus the mutually exclusive choices are known and preached.
