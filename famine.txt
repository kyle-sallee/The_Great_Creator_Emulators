A global    famine has  not  happened.
A magnitude more   food than can be eaten exists!

The food when globally shared from localized  famine persons do not die.
The food when not      shared from starvation death  results.

By famine   persons are not killed.
By war      persons are not killed.
By persons, persons are     killed.

By deprivation infliction
a  famine and war can be solicited.
By famine by  war the same question is posed.

Liberty      sustain?
Liberty when sustained
famine  is   thwarted
war     is   thwarted.

On freedom worlds famine and war are not inflicted.
