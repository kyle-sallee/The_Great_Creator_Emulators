"We are the borg."  "You will be assimilated."  "Resistance is futile."

From television "Star Trek the Next Generation" the above lines are quoted.

Compliant organic computers as liberty's end was postulated.

By the Borg       persons "manifest destiny" was represented.
By the Federation persons defiance           was represented.

In STtNG every person when borg assimilated liberty is defeated.

On Earth every person when law  compliant   liberty is defeated.
