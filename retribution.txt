Retribution to attain atrocity    is inflicted.
Sans volition  the    opportunity if present the atrocity is inflicted!

Forgiveness is   not required.
Liberty     to       sustain
retribution must be  abstained!

The temptation if not known the advice is easily doubted.
By  a medical  monopolist   the author's  mother was killed!
Prosecution    retribution  was abstained.

Matthew 5:38-42  please consider.

Retribution or freedom?  Since opposed both can not be attained!
With atrocious minds
the  atrocious minds are  reborn
The  atrocious minds when aggregated
the  atrocities      are  plentiful.
For  retribution
does that            not  suffice?
