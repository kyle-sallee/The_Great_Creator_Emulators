In Genesis 2 humanity  was    created.
In Genesis 3 humanity  became smart.
In Genesis 7 humanity, except Noah's clan, died.
Genesis 18:20  Genesis 19:1-29  please consider.
Who outcried?  Who were sent?  Who sentenced?  Who executed?  Angels!
Angelic intention was demonstrated.

Psalm 103:20  please consider
By angels to compliance    max       importance is accorded!
To angels    heterosapiens continued existence
if delegated termination   results.

By  angels all the    worlds
as             paydom worlds is     desired.
On         the paydom worlds comply or be killed is inflicted.
As  each       paydom world  self   destructs
the angels     celebrate!
