Luke 12:32-34 please consider.

To the deprived when giving       righteous behavior becomes.
Wealth to give  must           be attained.

With   enslavement
when   compliant small wealth is attained;
when   inflicted great wealth is attained.

Atrocity infliction and
atrocity compliance are not righteous.

Food    if          picked     and freely        given
art,    books,      music,         software   if authored and freely given
for     enslavement compliance and infliction is abstained.
To give enslavement is         not required   is          not justified.
