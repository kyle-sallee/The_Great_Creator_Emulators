In   Nippon   code  self defense is  criminalized?
In   Maryland code  home defense is  criminalized?
In   many     code       weapons are criminalized.
When in       peril the  defense why criminalize?

By  the DCO          compliant   victims              are wanted!
The victimization as deserved as justified the belief is  desired.

When dispossessed   when dehydrated when ill when shivering when starving
sans due  process   sans trial      sans conviction
the  lethal  deprivation infliction
the  capital punishment  infliction
as   justified      from victims
the  belief         is   desired.

During  siege    food fuel water   resupply     is  deprived.
By cold by starvation by   thirst  the denizens are weakened are killed.
Energy, food, home,   water when   deprived WAR atrocities   are inflicted!
Bombs,  bullets,      deprivation, disease, and homelessness     KILL!

One group only,  the police, when armed
war       is not approximated
GENOCIDE  is     approximated!

Food  when required an apple when sufficient;
home  when required a  hovel when sufficient;
water when required a  drink when sufficient;
the        atrocity    end        suffices.

Deprivation      since not justified life
deprivation      is    not justified.
A righteous kill is    an  oxymoron!

Liberty when sustained defense is not required.
Liberty when deprived  defense is     solicited.
