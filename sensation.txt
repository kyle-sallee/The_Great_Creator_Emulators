Importance  is not innate.  Importance     was     accorded was discovered.

Desired sensations  are     wanted.
When    unavailable boredom becomes.

Liberty where deprived for  relief
few     sensations are free and
few     sensations are purchasable.  Among   all economic classes
for     sensation      markets exist.
Few     sensations can be purchased.
More    sensations     to attain
on      freedom        world         rebirth is  required.

The  freedom     when creating when    sustaining
the  creativity, duration,     effort, tenacity,  volition
when required    when given    many    sensations are    attained.
Each day for     each person   desired sensations while  attained
the  payment     and  the      health  loss       are   abstained.
