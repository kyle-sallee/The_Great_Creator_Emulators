Walter Cox,  "Is the world more mind or matter?"
Kyle Sallee, "More buildings than brains exist."
Kyle Sallee, "The unknowable reality can only be approximated."
Kyle Sallee, "All facts  are merely  opinion."

A   bank note stack when received
a   squat, a wiping motion, and  a smile became.
For toilet paper the Bushman's gratitude became.

Disks,  gold, paper, silver are physical.
Credit, debt, money, value  are mental.

While empowered
paper as money is  perceived
disks as coins are perceived.
With  mental   the physical is varnished.

The   believed real world is    mental.
In  a virtual  fake world minds interact.
