Matthew 6:7  Matthew 7:21  please consider.
With  sinning on the mind
with  "Lord"  on the tongue
about sanctimonious  parishioners
what  opinion    is  solicited?

The Great Creator can  not      be worshiped!
The Great Creator when emulated is flattered!

Homily, karaoke, prayer, sermon, song, are ritualized entertainment!

By free minds     multi   million  dollar  churches are not operated!
An      authority self    purporting       minister is  not helpful.
About   anything  think.  Atrocity remove. Liberty  add.    Learning attain!

The thought if abstained
the action  is abstained
the outcome is abstained.
