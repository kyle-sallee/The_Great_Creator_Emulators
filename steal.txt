By The Great Creator all               atoms are    provided.
A  meal a home an outfit a person            please imagine.
A  meal a home an outfit a person sans atoms please imagine.
When    dead      per      person the  atoms are    surrendered.
When    borrowed  how      can    ownership  be     claimed?

Authority, code, ownership ideas when empowered
for atrocity infliction a weak justification is feigned.

The ownership   while impossible
the control     
the enslavement remains possible.

"Whitey stole our land!"  "Chinks stole our jobs!"
On paydom worlds by bigoted minds amusing absurd ideas are asserted.

With a continent or island who can abscond? To another planet was it moved?
A job, enslavement, is not even physical!
