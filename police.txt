In most police careers violent crime and burglary are never interrupted!

Rather than the Miranda rights
"The liberty to depart  is sustained," if recited;
an   arrest  a  booking if politely requested are weapons required?

By             law liberty is deprived
By the  police law         is enforced.

By      police
liberty deprivation since intended
liberty deprivation to    inflict   weapons are wielded.
By      police      non   compliant persons are captured, confined, or executed.
The     police
at      best        are   statisticians
at      worst       are   prosecution's armed bigoted murderous soldiers.
