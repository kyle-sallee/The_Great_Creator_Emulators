John 6:19  Mark 6:48  Matthew 14:25-26  please consider.

Against wind a boat while rowed slowly progresses.
Rather  than a boat and   oars
two gondola poles were    attained.
The gondola poles when    present less depth is  anticipated.
On  gondola poles about a meter   from the   top horizontal grips existed.

Below each knee the poles were fastened.
By    the  robe the pole  tops were covered.
On    the  grips    Jesus stood.
On    the  stilts   Jesus strode.

In  darkness while cloaked  above on the    lake  Jesus seemed   floating.
The boat     when  entered  into     the    water the   poles    slid.
By  Jesus    a     pole was retained and to shore the   boat was pushed.
By  darkness and   by       robe     the    pole  origin     was hid.

Scaffolding   for construction effort and duration     since required
by carpenters and masons   the ladder and stilt skills were  attained.
