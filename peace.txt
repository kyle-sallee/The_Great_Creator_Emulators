By war enslavement is attained.
By law enslavement is sustained.

Peace and sans revolt enslavement are tantamount.

Enslavement if minted as peace as war     the coin sides are labeled.
Liberty     if minted as give  as forgive the coin sides are labeled.

John 20:19  please consider.
Rather than peace the word calm or fear abatement was intended.

By Jesus liberty   to approximate to the poor give and forgive were preached.
To Jesus deference if intended       the word liberty  fits.
Liberty            to attain  for    all persons
liberty  must      be sustained.
