From the 1999 movie "The Matrix" the following is quoted.

"Morpheus,
 'The Matrix is everywhere.   It is all around us.
  Even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or
  when you turn on your television.
  You can feel it
  when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes.
  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes
  to blind you from the truth.' 
 Neo, 'What truth?'
 Morpheus,
 'That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else you were born into bondage,
  into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch, a prison for your mind.'"

Near the movie end.  "Neo, 'No.'"
With the     system the compliance when ended
the  control and    the  violence       ended.
While a liberty story the word liberty is not once mentioned.
