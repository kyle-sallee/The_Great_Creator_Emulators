Matthew 18:14  Matthew  6:26  Genesis  1:29  please consider.
For The Great Creator's gifts
by  The Great Creator   payment since not intended was not demanded.

Quran 3:93  Quran 5:5  please consider.
Sans payment use               when  criminalized
The  Great Creator's gifts
The  Great Creator's intention since criminalized
The  Great Creator's will      is    not done   is thwarted!
God  criminalize?  Liberty criminalize?  Plants criminalize?

Confinement,   deprivation, threats   globally  inflict?
As   hostage   as slave     every     mind      regard?
To   compliant persons      only
with reduced   confinement
with reduced   deprivation  continued existence grant?

By   authority    self purporting bigoted slaver minds
for  attainment a cost attached   method  only   when      provided
for  continued    victimization   beg?    A      compliant victim remain?
