Matthew 6:9-13  Matthew 18:21-35  please consider.
The word forgive when twice mentioned the importance is evident.

Forgiveness if  attained
retribution is abstained.

Forgiveness  and decision    differ!
Forgiveness, a   feeling, if desired to    attain can  be impossible!
Forgiveness  if  forced      fails.  Try?  Fail?  Self debase?

Forgiveness when    impossible
liberty     remains   possible!

To liberty     max importance when accorded
to retribution the importance is   abstained.
