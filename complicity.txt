Matthew 5:38-42  please consider.  For atrocity justification is impossible.
Atrocity when not thwarted when  enabled  when   complicit
the      cowardly decision for a lifetime can be regretted.

Violence when witnessed thought ceases shock becomes.
Nothing  when trained   is  solicited.
Adrenal  rage           if  solicited
liberty  importance     is  abstained.
Kills to abstain skills are required!

In the  paydom "police"  when shouted all action is not tacitly arrested.
In the freedom "liberty" when shouted all action is     tacitly arrested,
self   evaluation follows.
In the freedom only atrocity defense skills are optional.
Proverbs 24:10-12  please consider.
