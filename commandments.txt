Exodus  please consider.  "What is important?  What must be done?" was asked.
"Liberty" was replied.  By Moses, an enslaved mind, enslaved minds were led.
By enslaved minds
to what extent can liberty              be comprehended?
To what extent can rules and compliance be comprehended?

Exodus  20:1-21   Deuteronomy  5
Matthew 19:16-24  Matthew     19:21     James 2:14-26
Luke    12:32-34  Matthew     18:21-35  please consider.
By Jesus the  10  Commandments   as  sufficient is refuted.

Matthew 22:1-14  Matthew 7:13-14  please consider.
Jesus's heaven to enter the proper proclivities are required.

Moses   if followed  on Sheol          rebirth is attained.
Jesus   if followed  on Heaven         rebirth is attained.
Liberty if sustained on freedom worlds rebirth is attained.

By  minds the liberty idea is not comprehended, but rather approximated.
For minds by The Great Creator liberty since intended divine law NEVER existed!
