A fur clad traveler while fishing a weapon wielding person clash!

Cop,  "Poacher, to arrest to binding to confinement to deprivation submit!"
Bear, "Hungry!"
Cop,  "Submit!"
Bear, "Bear eat fish!"
Cop,  "What bear?"
Bear, "Me bear!"
Cop,  "Bears can't talk."
Bear, "With bear first, time?"
Cop,  "Well, yeah.  Sorry.  Goodbye."

For bear    liberty sustain?
For persons liberty deprive?

Matthew 6:26  please consider.
Quran   5:5   please consider.

Should bears   eat?
Should persons starve or be prosecuted?
