1 John 1:9  James 5:16  please consider.

An    atrocity   if  hid others if blamed then nothing is learned.
An    atrocity   if  hid
more  atrocity       can be solicited.
From  disclosure all can    learn.

On   freedom   worlds    an     atrocity    aft  infliction
the  details   are       often  published.  When read
a    similar   atrocity  can be avoided.
Or   effective atonement can be learned.
When published for   the victim importance  is   demonstrated.

With atrocious  persons     atrocities like    wild   fire     spread.
By   Christians forgiveness while      desired retribution is  inflicted.
An   atrocity   aft         infliction perfect outcomes    are precluded.

On freedom worlds liberty as    possible is          restored.
On  paydom worlds liberty since deprived retribution becomes.
