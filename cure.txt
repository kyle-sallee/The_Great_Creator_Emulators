Matthew 10:1  Mark 3:14-15  Mark 6:6-7  Luke 4:36  Luke 9:1  please consider.
To cure illness
to heal injury
to dispossess minds
Jesus and apostles were said to wield authority.
Rather than authority
for    word ability might be better?

The     authority idea  to      empower a  mind is required.
For     bacteria, fungi and,    virus   do minds exist?
If  not authority would not  be empowered.
