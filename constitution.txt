More lines from Shakespeare than any Constitutions are typically memorized.

In paydoms liberty is deprived!

By Constitution
to citizens
to slaves
a  few meager rights only are granted.

By most minds those  rights are not recollected!
Furthermore   slaves seldom care!

Rather    than       to liberty
rather    than       to rights
to        sensation     attainment
to        wealth        attainment
paramount importance is accorded.
