Matthew  7:1-6  please consider.  Bigotry was denounced.
Matthew 18:1-3  please consider.
By young minds bigotry,  deprivation, slavery is  least inflicted.
By young minds learning, helping,     sharing are desired.

Liberty  as anarchy   if asserted
law      as essential is asserted
few only as worthy    is believed
bigotry  as worthy    is believed.

By legislators atrocities are   threatened.
To all persons enactment  power since   not granted legislators  differ!
Threats   when inflicted  justification to  feign   bigotry must be empowered.

Bigotry when       abstained  an action
for any person  if atrocious
for all persons is atrocious!

Agism, racism, religism, rolism, sexism, etc...  any bigotry when sustained
on     freedom worlds    rebirth since   not desired is      not   attained.
