"Pharmaceuticals do not kill,
 pharmaceuticals save lives!"  by naive minds is thought.

For  kills
for  maims
the  lawsuits        are solicited.
From lawsuits until      unprofitable
the  pharmaceutical  is  made,  prescribed, sold.

A    pharmaceutical  is  swallowed.
To   work slaves     go. Lethal pathogens   spread.
More pharmaceuticals are sold   and         consumed.

By   pharmaceuticals use life   when terminated
what compensation    is  worthy?
By   the fiction         called money
can  any life        be  replaced?
