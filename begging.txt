Luke 11:9-13  Matthew 7:7-12  please consider.
The  asking     while righteous
for  money      if    asking
from others     for   enslavement
the  compliance or
the  infliction is    tacitly requested.

Shelter when deprived from several  persons money if begged
for     room payment  the  demanded amount  can   be acquired.

Like televangelists for more wealth when begging enslavement is     intended.
For  continued      existence       when begging enslavement is not intended.
The  deprivation    atrocity relief is   desired.
