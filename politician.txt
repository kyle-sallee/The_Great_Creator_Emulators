In the paydom
by uninterested bigoted minds, politicians, decisions while made;
by uninterested bigoted minds, lobbyists,   the politicians are influenced.

The   endorsed and the confidence can     entirely  differ.
For   example  a   non smoker     tobacco lobbyists please consider.
"Sure tobacco smokers
 from cancer  often    horribly   die.
 From cancer  to       horribly   die 
 the  liberty must  be sustained,"        lobbyists might  assert.

Why are politicians not in trenches dying           and killing?
Why are politicians not on streets  homeless, dirty and starving?
Why do  politicians seldom eat      their     bitter    fruits?
By      politicians deprivation,    famine,   genocide, war
while   inflicted   is     seldom   endured.

On  freedom    worlds liberty   since   sustained
to  bigoted    minds  decisions are not delegated;
all interested minds                    participate!
