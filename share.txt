John 6:1-13  Luke 9:10-17  Mark 6:30-44  Matthew 14:13-21  please consider.
When sharing everyone   can  eat.
Less than    sufficient when anticipated
more than    enough     can  become.

On  liberty deprived world
the liberty when     sustained
the outcome as       miraculous is proclaimed.

By   the            person  plethora   be undaunted.
By   5     thousand persons
by   8     billion  persons or more
when asked give!
The  Jesus similar  giving  proclivity is required!
