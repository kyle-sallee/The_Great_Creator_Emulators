Matthew 13:42  Matthew 13:44-46  please consider

Hell   and a  blazing   furnace differ.
Heaven and an expensive pearl   differ.

Revelations 20  Revelations 20:10  please consider.

The paydom when sustained worlds self destruct.
By  atomic bomb plasma is a fire lake approximation not exceeded?

Bio warfare worlds, polluted  worlds, radio   active worlds
on  which   hell    world     is      rebirth desired?

On  Earth  what    atrocities are     abstained and
for hell   alone   reserved?
